# MIT 6.5840 (6.824) Distributed Systems – Lab Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the **MIT 6.5840 Distributed Systems** labs (formerly known as **6.824**). The course emphasizes concepts such as fault tolerance, replication, Raft consensus, sharding, and distributed key/value stores — implemented in **Go**.

> ⚠️ **Academic Honesty Note:**  
> These solutions are for **learning and reference only**. If you are currently taking the course, please do **not copy** this code. Understand the concepts and write your own implementation.

## 🚀 Labs Overview

| Lab | Topic | Status |
|-----|-----------------------------|--------|
| Lab 1 | MapReduce | ✅ Completed |
| Lab 2 | Key/Value Server | ✅ Completed |
| Lab 3 | Raft Consensus Algorithm | ✅ Completed |
| Lab 4 | Fault-Tolerant Key/Value Service using Raft | ✅ Completed |
| Lab 5 | Sharded Key/Value Store | ✅ Completed |
| Lab 5 | Extended Features | 🔧 Not Started |

Each lab builds on the previous one, eventually forming a replicated and sharded fault-tolerant distributed key/value store.
